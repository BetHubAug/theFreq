        <h2>The Core Technologies</h2>
        <p>We are utilizing a range of cutting-edge technologies, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom Spatial Audio Systems:</strong> Engineered for precise frequency delivery.</li>
            <li><strong>Tactile Transducers:</strong> Providing targeted vibration.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic LED Lighting Arrays:</strong> For controlled light stimulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Binaural Beat Generators:</strong> To induce specific brainwave states.</li>
            <li><strong>Biofeedback Sensors:</strong> To personalize interventions using real time data analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Proprietary Software:</strong> To manage all systems with customizable user experience.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

   <section>
        <h2>Scientific Principles</h2>
            <p>Our approach is rooted in well established scientific principles:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>   <strong>Neuromodulation:</strong> Altering brain activity through external stimuli, with specific application of frequency to entrain brainwaves and influence states of consciousness.
             <li>    <strong>Solfeggio Frequencies:</strong>  Historical tones hypothesized to have particular healing and wellness benefits. (Note: While anecdotal evidence suggests benefits, we are pursuing ongoing research). 174 Hz: Pain Reduction, 285 Hz: Tissue Regeneration, 528 Hz: DNA Repair, etc
              <li>  <strong>Binaural Beats:</strong> Creating auditory illusions to induce specific brainwave states.
               <li>  <strong>Gamma Frequencies:</strong> Tapping into frequencies known to enhance creativity, focus, and flow.
               <li> <strong>Light Frequencies:</strong> Understanding the connection between light, and the body's natural circadian rhythm.
               <li> <strong>Vibration Therapy:</strong> Using low frequency vibrations to support muscle relaxation, pain reduction, and improved blood flow.
             </ul>
